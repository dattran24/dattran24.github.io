I am an Assistant Professor in Mathematics at <a href='https://www.rowan.edu/'>Rowan University </a>.  I earned my Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics in 2025 at Wayne State University under the supervision of <a href='https://borismordukhovich.com/'>Prof. Boris Mordukhovich</a> and <a href='https://sites.google.com/site/khanhpd182/'>Prof. Pham Duy Khanh</a> at Ho Chi Minh City University of Education. My recent research interests lie at the intersection of optimization theory and machine learning, including, but not limited to:

<ul>
    <li>Variational analysis</li>
    <li>Mathematical optimization</li>
    <li>Machine learning and statistical learning theory </li>
  </ul>

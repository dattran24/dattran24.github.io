Hi! I am currently a Ph.D. student at Wayne University, working with <a href='https://borismordukhovich.com/'>Prof. Boris Mordukhovich</a> from the Mathematics department and <a href='https://sites.google.com/site/khanhpd182/'>Dr. Pham Duy Khanh</a> at Ho Chi Minh City University of Education. My recent research interests lie in the intersection of optimization theory and machine learning, including but not limited to:

<ul>
    <li>Variational analysis</li>
    <li>Mathematical optimization</li>
    <li>Machine learning and statistical learning theory </li>
  </ul>
